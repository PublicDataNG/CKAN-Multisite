# CKAN Content Export

These are examples for the [CKAN Content Export RFP](https://screendoor.dobt.co/u-s-open-data-institute/ckan-content-export/). They were generated by installing CKAN, creating one user and adding a single dataset, with two resources (an uploaded file and a linked, remote file).

[users.csv](users.csv): A list of all users registered with the CKAN instance. All but `admin` are automatically generated by CKAN, internally. `admin` is not necessarily the name of the administrative account—the user can select any name that they desire. There may be _many_ more users than are found in this example.

[datasets.json](datasets.json): All datasets registered with the site. Each dataset will have one or more “resources” (files, remote URLs, or APIs) listed. It would be very unusual for a site to have just one dataset and two resources, as found in this example—most will have dozens or hundreds of datasets and resources, while some will have thousands. The cumulative size of hosted datasets could be many gigabytes, but for the use case of this RFP, it’s likely to be measured in no more than hundreds of megabytes.
